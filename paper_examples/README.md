Examples from the reconstructions using L-BFGS-L in the paper "Bridging BridgingBridging and improving inverse solutions with data completion" by Tan Bui-Thanh, Qin Li, and Leonardo Zepeda-Nunez

We include the data folder we include the DtN already completed (using CVX), along with the original data, the sampling mask and all the necessary indeces and data structutures to reproduce the results in the paper. We point out that given that the scripts were tested for very long times. Thus it would take a long time to run them. 

For a much shorter demonstration of the codes please refers to the examples folder in the root of the repository.
